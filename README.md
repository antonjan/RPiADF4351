# RPiADF4351
Control an ADF4351 using spi on any GPIO pins from a Raspberry Pi

call using sudo ./adf4351 fff.f

fff.f is the frequency in MHz (>35 and <4400)

or sudo ./adf4351 off to turn the VCO off

GPIO pins for LE, CLK and DATA can be set in adf4351.c using wiringPi numbering.
# Dependency
You will need the following to compile the above.<br>
git clone https://github.com/WiringPi/WiringPi.git<br>
cd ./WiringPi<br>
Building the code<br>
./build<br>
# Checking your pin status and direction configuration.
The gpio should be installed by default on Raspberry pi<br>
Pins 17, 18, 19 and 20: (BCM_GPIO 28, 29, 30 and 31) These are additional GPIO pins on the Rev. 2 board.<br>
Remember: The Raspberry Pi is a 3.3 volt device! Attempting to directly connect to any 5V logic system will very likely result in tearsâ€¦<br>
